Analysing Amazon customer reviews via Clustering, Visualization and Classification.


# Motivation 

Product reviews reveal customer sentiments helping the manufacturers decide what is required to make the product a success. Depending on the reviews provided by the users, the product is classified as good or bad and improvements can be made accordingly to cater to the requirements of the customers. I have chosen to analyse review on Amazon Products from datasets obtained via two different sources.
